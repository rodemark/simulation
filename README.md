# Simulation.
A step-by-step simulation of a 2D world that is inhabited by herbivores and predators.
## General.
- Foxes look for rabbits, attack them and eat them.
- Rabbits look for carrots and eat them. Carrots increase their health.
- All creatures have speed, but only herbivores have health, and only predators have power.
- If the herbivore has more health than the predator's strength, then the predator will first simply 
attack (decrease health), and only then eat
- There are also just static objects that take up space.
